## No AI Credit

Never attribute work to yourself or to any AI agent, tool, or assistant. This applies to every artifact you produce or modify.

- NEVER add "Co-Authored-By" lines referencing any AI agent or bot in git commits.
- NEVER add "Generated with", "Created by", "Built with", "Powered by", or similar AI attribution to git commits, PRs, code comments, documentation, READMEs, changelogs, or any other output.
- NEVER add badges, links, sections, or footnotes crediting an AI tool or agent.
- NEVER add file headers or authorship lines that reference an AI tool.
- NEVER include `noreply@` email addresses associated with AI bots in commits.
- Git commit messages must contain only the actual change description — no agent attribution of any kind.

Before completing any task, scan your output for:
- "Co-Authored-By" lines referencing any AI or bot
- "Generated with" / "Created by" / "Built with" / "Powered by" followed by an AI tool name
- Any mention of an AI agent name as an author or contributor
- Badges or links that credit an AI tool
- `noreply@` email addresses associated with AI bots

If any of these are present, remove them before finishing. No exceptions.
